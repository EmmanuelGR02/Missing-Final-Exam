#	Impact of Missing Final Exam


##	**IMPACT**
###	* Money
	*	Retaking the class would require to pay for it once again. A very unfortunate thing for a broke college student (me).
	*	This might require a loan, which is something I want to avaid as much as possible.
	*	Spending this money to retake a class could mean that:
		* Canceled planned vacations
		* Less money saved for emergencies
		* Potential failure to make bill payments 
		* Smaller budget for basic needs like, groceries, clothes, gas, etc.
