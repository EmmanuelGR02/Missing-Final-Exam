#	Impact of Missing Final Exam


##	**IMPACT**
### 1. Money
	* Retaking the class would require to pay for it once again. A very unfortunate thing for a broke college student (me).
	* This might require a loan, which is something I want to avaid as much as possible.
	* Spending this money to retake a class could mean that:
		1. Canceled planned vacations
		2. Less money saved for emergencies
		3. Potential failure to make bill payments 
		4. Smaller budget for basic needs like, groceries, clothes, gas, etc.
