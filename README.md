#	Impact of Missing Final Exam


##	**IMPACT**
### 1. Money
* Retaking the class would require to pay for it once again. A very unfortunate thing for a broke college student (me).
* This might require a loan, which is something I want to avaid as much as possible.
* Spending this money to retake a class could mean that:
	* Canceled planned vacations
	* Less money saved for emergencies
	* Potential failure to make bill payments 
	* Smaller budget for basic needs like, groceries, clothes, gas, etc.

### 2. Time
* In terms of time, it could defenitely delay the year of my graduation, which directly affects the progression in my professional career.
* I would need to keep working two jobs, and ask for more hours to be added into my schedules in order to pay for the tuition. This can affect my time management since I will still be taking other classes, giving me less time to focus on them. More work ours (to pay for the retake) = less time to focus on classes = potential of failing another class = repeat of cycle.

### 3. Professional Life
* Since I mentioned how this event can potentially cause me to fail multiple classes in the worst case senario,
and only one in the best case, it will delay me getting myself out into the professional world. 
It will now take me longer to get into better positions due to aquiring my diplama later than anticipated, 
and I will be less experienced, which is crucial as software companies prioritize experienced candidates.

### 4. Personal Life
* Debt/Less finacially stable
* Less personal time 
* Lots of "what am I doing with my life" thoughts
* All of these impacts will make my parents very upset. (Let's not talk about the lecture my mom gave me
when I told her I didn't wake up for my final)


## **CPE**: `cpe:/h:viviana:emmanuel:21.0`


## **Threat Sources**
* Work:
	* Work was definitely a threat source. During the week, I usually go work early morning the days
	I didn't have class, and then I went to my other job, which was done at night, and I end the day
	by going to the gym. This left me with almost no time to study during the week.
	Saturdays and Sundays I only work 4-8 hours early morning, leaving time to study the rest of the day.
* Linear Algebra:
	* The final for linear algebra was the main threat source. I had a D on the class, but the professor
	said that if we get a 94 on the final, we get a A for the class, or if we get a 85 on the final,
	we get a B for the class. I had to go super tryhard on studying 26 chapters. Saturday I 
	decided not to pull an all-nighter, so I slept about 4 hours. I called off word Sunday 
	so I could study all day and I did pull an all-nighter and did not stop studying until
	12:30pm Monday when I had to the final (I got an 85!). After the exam I went to work
	and got out at 9, then got home at 9:30 (definitely wasn't going to go to the gym).
	I went over the class github for about 2 hours, put 2 alarms and fell asleep. Then I just
	woke up at 10, with no memory of me hearing my alarms at all.
	* I always hear my alarms (me deciding to snooze 10 times is a different story), but in this case
	 I don't think putting more than 2 would have made a huge difference. Telling my sibling to wake me
	up before she went to school would have been way more effective.
