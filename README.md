#	Impact of Missing Final Exam


##	**IMPACT**
### 1. Money
* Retaking the class would require to pay for it once again. A very unfortunate thing for a broke college student (me).
* This might require a loan, which is something I want to avaid as much as possible.
* Spending this money to retake a class could mean that:
	* Canceled planned vacations
	* Less money saved for emergencies
	* Potential failure to make bill payments 
	* Smaller budget for basic needs like, groceries, clothes, gas, etc.

### 2. Time
* In terms of time, it could defenitely delay the year of my graduation, which directly affects the progression in my professional career.
* I would need to keep working two jobs, and ask for more hours to be added into my schedules in order to pay for the tuition. This can affect my time management since I will still be taking other classes, giving me less time to focus on them. More work ours (to pay for the retake) = less time to focus on classes = potential of failing another class = repeat of cycle.

### 3. Professional life
	* Since I mentioned how this event can potentially cause me to fail multiple classes in the worst case senario, and only one in the best case, it will delay me getting myself out into the professional world. It will now take me longer to get into better positions due to aquiring my diplama later than anticipated, and I will be less experienced, which is crucial as software companies prioritize experienced candidates.
